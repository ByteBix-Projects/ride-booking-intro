```

### Enhanced Components

1. **Auth Service** (New)
   - JWT/OAuth2 authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Session management

2. **Dynamic Pricing Service** (Enhanced)
   - Real-time surge pricing
   - Machine learning predictions
   ```python
   def calculate_fare(base, distance, time, surge):
       return (base + (distance * 1.5) + (time * 0.2)) * surge
   ```

3. **Driver Service** (Enhanced)
   - Driver profile management
   - Vehicle information
   - Availability status

4. **Analytics Service** (New)
